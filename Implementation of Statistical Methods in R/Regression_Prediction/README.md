# Regression Prediction Project

## Title
Predicting Weight Based on Multiple Predictors

## Description
This project aims to predict a person's weight based on several factors using linear regression models. The primary objective is to determine the most effective model for accurate predictions by comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

### What is your project?
The project involves fitting linear regression models to training data and evaluating their performance on test data. The goal is to predict the weight of individuals based on various predictors such as height, gender, diet, and lifestyle factors.

### Usage Examples
- Predicting weight for new individuals based on their height and gender.
- Comparing the accuracy of different regression models.
- Evaluating the significance of different predictors in weight prediction.

### Issues or Limitations of the Project
- The dataset is limited to a specific group of students, which may not generalize well to other populations.
- The models assume linear relationships between predictors and the response variable, which might not capture all nuances.

### Future Features
- Implementing non-linear regression models to capture more complex relationships.
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse populations for better generalization.
- Integrating additional predictors to improve prediction accuracy.

## Technologies
- **R Programming Language**: Used for data analysis and model building.
- **Libraries**: `corrplot` for visualizing correlation matrices, base R functions for regression analysis.

### Instructions for Installation
1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Install the necessary libraries in R:
   ```R
   install.packages("corrplot")
   ```

### Why did you choose your technology?
R was chosen for its powerful statistical analysis capabilities and extensive libraries for data visualization and regression modeling.

## Details about Use

### Reading Data
Set the working directory and read the training and testing datasets:
```R
setwd("/path/to/your/directory")
training_data <- read.csv("Train.csv")
test_data <- read.csv("Test.csv")
```

### Fitting Models and Predictions
Fit a linear regression model using all predictor variables:
```R
model <- lm(y ~ ., data = training_data)
```

Make predictions for both training and test sets:
```R
training_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = training_data)
test_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)
```

### Visualization
Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values:
```R
combined_data <- data.frame(
  Group = c(rep("Training", nrow(training_data)), rep("Test", nrow(test_data))),
  Actual = c(training_data$y, test_data$y),
  Predicted = c(training_predictions, test_predictions)
)

plot(
  Predicted ~ Actual,
  data = combined_data,
  pch = ifelse(combined_data$Group == "Training", 16, 17),
  col = ifelse(combined_data$Group == "Training", "green", "red"),
  xlab = "Actual Weight",
  ylab = "Predicted Weight",
  main = "Actual vs Predicted Weight"
)
legend("topright", legend = c("Training", "Test"), pch = c(16, 17), col = c("green", "red"))
```

### Standardized Residuals
Plot standardized residuals vs fitted values:
```R
training_residuals <- rstandard(model)
plot(fitted(model), training_residuals, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Standardized Residuals", main = "Standardized Residuals vs Fitted Values")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
lines(lowess(fitted(model), training_residuals), col = "green")
```

## Dependencies
- **R 4.0 or higher**
- **R Libraries**: `corrplot`
