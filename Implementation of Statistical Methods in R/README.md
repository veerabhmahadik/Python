### Implementation of Statistical Methods in R

#### Description
This project applies various statistical methods using R to analyze different datasets. It contains two subfolders: Newfood_QualityControl and Regression_Prediction, each focusing on different aspects of statistical analysis.

#### Newfood_QualityControl

##### Project Objectives
- Perform quality control analysis on production data.
- Identify factors affecting product defects and provide actionable insights.
- Conduct regression analysis and interpret the results.

##### Usage Examples
- Analyzing production data to improve quality control.
- Identifying key variables affecting defect rates in production.
- Providing recommendations for process improvements.

##### Issues or Limitations
- Data quality and completeness can impact the accuracy of the analysis.
- Regression models may have multicollinearity issues affecting interpretation.

##### Future Features
- Enhance data collection processes for better quality control.
- Implement real-time monitoring and analysis of production data.

##### Folder Contents
- **Newfood_QualityControl_Code.R**: R script containing the quality control analysis.
- **Newfood_QualityCOntrol_Report.pdf**: Detailed report on the quality control analysis.
- **newfood.csv**: Dataset used for the quality control analysis.
- **newfood.pdf**: Additional documentation for the Newfood case.
- **quality.csv**: Additional dataset for quality control.
- **qualityControl.pdf**: Detailed documentation on the quality control case.

#### Regression_Prediction

##### Project Objectives
- Develop regression models to predict sales based on various factors.
- Evaluate the impact of pricing, advertising, and location on sales.
- Provide recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies.

##### Usage Examples
- Predicting sales based on different marketing strategies.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
- Optimizing pricing strategies for new products.

##### Issues or Limitations
- The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and relevance of the data.
- External factors not included in the model can affect sales predictions.

##### Future Features
- Incorporate additional variables and data sources for improved predictions.
- Develop interactive dashboards for better visualization and interpretation.

##### Folder Contents
- **Regression_Prediction.R**: R script containing the regression analysis and predictions.
- **Regression_Prediction_Report.pdf**: Detailed report on the regression analysis and predictions.
- **Regression_Prediction_Questions.pdf**: PDF with detailed questions and explanations for the regression analysis.
- **Train.csv**: Training dataset used for the regression analysis.
- **Test.csv**: Test dataset used for the regression analysis.
