### Predictive Modeling and Financial Analysis

#### Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model for a retail company that sells upscale clothing on its website and through catalogs. The goal is to predict which customers will respond to similar future promotions and how much they will purchase.

#### Usage Examples
- Predicting customer response to future catalog mailings.
- Identifying key factors influencing customer purchases.
- Optimizing marketing strategies by targeting the right customers.

#### Issues or Limitations
- The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and completeness of the data.
- The predictive power may vary with different customer demographics or market conditions.

#### Future Features
- Incorporate additional data sources for improved predictions.
- Develop interactive visualizations for better insights.
- Implement real-time prediction capabilities.
